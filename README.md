Solar trackers increase the efficiency of solar panels by following the sun's 
movement. This paper provides an overview of solar trackers. Solar trackers have 
the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of solar power systems.


I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my advisor,
[Dr. Eslam shaalan], for their invaluable guidance, encouragement, and support 
throughout the duration of this project. Their knowledge and expertise in the field 
of solar energy were instrumental in the successful completion of this report.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the members of my team, [Youssef, 
Nour and Nada], for their hard work and contributions to this project. Their 
dedication and critical thinking skills were essential to the success of this project.
Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the support and assistance provided by 
[Dr. Mohamed Boraiy], who generously provided the materials and resources 
necessary for the construction of our solar tracker.
Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support 
and encouragement throughout this project. Their belief in me and my abilities 
kept me motivated and focused during the challenging moments.
Without the contributions of these individuals and organizations, this project 
would not have been possible. Thank you all for your help and support.
